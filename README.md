### About game

Mancala Game, a two-player abstract strategy board game. Mancala is a game that has been played for many years. It's one of the oldest African traditional board game.

### Rules

> The game begins with one player picking up all of the
> pieces in any one of the holes on his side.
> Moving counter-clockwise, the player deposits one of the
> stones in each hole until the stones run out.
>
> 1. If you run into your own store, deposit one piece in it. If you run into your opponent's store, skip it.
> 2. If the last piece you drop is in your own store, you get a free turn.
> 3. If the last piece you drop is in an empty hole on your side, you capture that piece and any pieces in the hole directly opposite.
> 4. Always place all captured pieces in your store.
